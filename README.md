# Applying-Low-pass-filter-to-audio-file-with-variable-cutoff-frequency-input-by-user
This project implements a low-pass filter to attenuate frequencies above a user-defined cutoff frequency. A low-pass filter passes signals with frequencies lower than the cutoff and attenuates higher frequencies. Known as a high-cut or treble-cut filter in audio, it is the complement of a high-pass filter. Applications include electronic circuits (e.g., hiss filters in audio), anti-aliasing filters for signal conditioning, digital filters for data smoothing, acoustic barriers, and image blurring. The moving average in finance is also a low-pass filter. Low-pass filters smooth signals by removing short-term fluctuations and preserving long-term trends. Designers use a low-pass prototype with unity bandwidth and impedance, scaling it for desired specifications. This repository includes the filter design, user interface for setting the cutoff frequency, and examples for various applications.
